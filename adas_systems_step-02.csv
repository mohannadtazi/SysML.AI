Let me provide you with a complete description of the Adaptive Cruise Control system:

# Technical Details
- Radar and Camera Sensors: The ACC system employs a combination of radar and camera sensors to detect and track the distance, speed, and trajectory of the preceding vehicle. The radar sensor operates at a frequency of 77 GHz and has a range of up to 200 meters, while the camera sensor is a high-resolution, monocular camera with a 30-degree field of view.
- GPS and INERTIAL Measurement Unit (IMU): The ACC system uses GPS and IMU data to determine the vehicle's speed, acceleration, and yaw rate. This data is used to improve the system's accuracy and stability.
- Electronic Control Unit (ECU): The ECU is the brain of the ACC system, responsible for processing data from the sensors, calculating the vehicle's speed and distance, and sending commands to the vehicle's powertrain and braking systems. The ECU is a 32-bit microcontroller with a clock speed of 200 MHz and 2 MB of flash memory.
- Powertrain and Braking System Interface: The ACC system interfaces with the vehicle's powertrain and braking systems through a dedicated CAN bus. The system can adjust engine torque, transmission gear shifts, and brake pressure to maintain a safe distance from the preceding vehicle.
